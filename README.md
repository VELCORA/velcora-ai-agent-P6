> **Velcora AI Agent** — rebranded AI chatbot starter (Vercel AI SDK) customized for Velcora.
> Workflow modes (sales / marketing / R&D / recruiting / support) are defined in `lib/ai/modes.ts`.

### Environment Variables (required for deploy)

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POSTGRES_URL` | Neon Postgres connection string — DB migrate + runtime. **Required.** |
| `REDIS_URL` | **Upstash Redis TLS URL** (`rediss://:TOKEN@HOST:PORT`). Note: Upstash's Vercel integration auto-injects `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`/`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` — the code reads `REDIS_URL`, so copy the `rediss://` connection string manually. |
| `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` | Vercel Blob for file uploads (auto-injected when a Blob store is connected to the project) |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Auth.js session secret (`npx auth secret` / `openssl rand -base64 33`) |
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | Vercel AI Gateway key — auto via OIDC on Vercel; set this only for non-Vercel or explicit control |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Public site URL (metadata + footer link). Vercel auto-domain = `https://velcora-ai-agent-p6.vercel.app` |

Set these in the Vercel project dashboard **before** the first build (the build runs `tsx lib/db/migrate`, which needs `POSTGRES_URL`).

## Model Providers

This template uses the [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) to access multiple AI models through a unified interface. Models are configured in `lib/ai/models.ts` with per-model provider routing. Included models: Mistral, Moonshot, DeepSeek, OpenAI, and xAI.

### AI Gateway Authentication

**For Vercel deployments**: Authentication is handled automatically via OIDC tokens.

**For non-Vercel deployments**: You need to provide an AI Gateway API key by setting the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env.local` file.

With the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), you can also switch to direct LLM providers like [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/chatbot)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate # Setup database or apply latest database changes
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
